# Contributing to Nitori Core

Nitori Core provides a set of core classes and utilities for Nitori projects, implementing all the basic resources class and API definitions for Satori Protocol.

## Project Structure

Following the [Satori Protocol](https://satori.js.org/zh-CN/resources/channel.html) definition, Nitori Core has the same structure as Satori Protocol.

```
lib/
  src/
    base.dart
    channel.dart
    guild.dart
    guild_member.dart
    guild_role.dart
    login.dart
    message.dart
    user.dart
```

You would see that there are some files suffixed with `.g.dart`, which are generated by [build_runner](https://pub.dev/packages/build_runner) and [json_serializable](https://pub.dev/packages/json_serializable). You can run `dart run build_runner build` to generate them once you have modified the corresponding `.dart` files.
